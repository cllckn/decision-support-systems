# Hands-On Exercise 2: Build a Simple Web Application with Node.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Objective

Students will develop a basic web application that includes a login form and a dashboard page. The application will utilize:

- **Node.js** to serve static files and handle routing.
- **HTML & CSS** for structuring and styling the pages.
- **JavaScript** for client-side form validation and handling login logic.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Set Up Node.js Server
- Install Node.js (Ensure students have Node.js installed).
- Initialize a Node.js project.
- Install Express.
- Develop a new file for the server and set up routing.
- Set up a `public` folder to store static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).

### Task 2: Design HTML & CSS for Login Form
- Inside the `public` folder, develop an HTML file for the login page.
- Add form elements for username, password, and a login button.
- Build a CSS file to style the login form, ensuring a user-friendly design.

### Task 3: Implement JavaScript for Login Validation
- Add JavaScript to validate required fields in the login form.
- Implement client-side logic to check if the username and password match predefined values.
- Display an error message if the credentials are incorrect.
- Redirect to the dashboard upon successful login.

### Task 4: Develop the Dashboard Page
- Develop an HTML file for the dashboard.
- Ensure it includes a welcome message and a logout link.

### Task 5: Run and Test the Application
- Start the Node.js server.
- Open the application in a web browser.
- **Test login:**
   - Enter valid credentials to access the dashboard.
   - Enter incorrect credentials to see an error message.

## Expected Outcome

Students will have a functional login system where:

- Form fields are required.
- JavaScript validates credentials.
- Users are redirected to a dashboard upon successful login.
- Incorrect login displays an error message.

# Expert Knowledge and Decision Support Systems 

A Decision Support System (DSS) is a computer-based tool that helps individuals or organizations make better decisions by analyzing data, applying models, and presenting actionable insights. It is particularly useful for solving semi-structured and unstructured problems, where human judgment and data analysis need to work together.

## Course Objectives
* To introduce students to the concepts of expert knowledge and decision support systems (DSS).
* To develop skills in building web-based decision support systems using modern tools and frameworks.
* To provide hands-on experience with data processing, visualization, and machine learning for decision-making.
* To explain foundational machine learning models and fuzzy logic in the context of decision support.

## Course Content
The course will cover the following topics:
### Module 1: Introduction to Expert Systems and Decision Support Systems
* Overview of expert systems and DSS
* Applications of DSS in various domains (e.g., healthcare, finance, logistics)
* Components of a DSS: data management, model management, user interface
* Introduction to the tools: Python, Node.js, Kafka, jQuery

### Module 2: Data Processing and Communication
* Python for Data Processing:
* Data manipulation with Python
* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Kafka for Real-Time Data Streaming:
* Introduction to Kafka and its role in DSS
* Setting up Kafka producers and consumers
* Integrating Kafka with Python

### Module 3: Building Web Services with Node.js
* Introduction to Node.js and Express.js
* Creating RESTful APIs for DSS
* Integrating Python-based models with Node.js APIs
* Handling asynchronous operations

### Module 4: Visualization and User Interface
* jQuery for Interactive Visualizations:
* Basics of jQuery and DOM manipulation
* Integrating charts and graphs using libraries like Chart.js
* Building a user-friendly interface for DSS

### Module 5: Machine Learning for Decision Support
* Introduction to machine learning in DSS
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines (SVM)
* K-Means Clustering
* Artificial Neural Networks (ANN):
* Basics of ANN and their role in decision-making
* Building a simple ANN using Python (TensorFlow/Keras)

### Module 6: Fuzzy Logic for Decision Support
* Introduction to fuzzy logic and its applications in DSS
* Fuzzy sets and membership functions
* Building a simple fuzzy logic system in Python

### Module 7: Integrating Components into a DSS
* Combining data processing, machine learning, and visualization
* Case studies: Building a DSS for a real-world problem (e.g., healthcare diagnostics, financial forecasting)
* Best practices for deploying and maintaining DSS

### Course Policies

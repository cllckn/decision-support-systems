# Expert Knowledge and Decision Support Systems 

A Decision Support System (DSS) is a computer-based tool that helps individuals or organizations make better decisions by analyzing data, applying models, and presenting actionable insights. It is particularly useful for solving semi-structured and unstructured problems, where human judgment and data analysis need to work together.

## Course Objectives
* To introduce students to the concepts of expert knowledge and decision support systems (DSS).
* To develop skills in building web-based decision support systems using modern tools and frameworks.
* To provide hands-on experience with data processing, visualization, and machine learning for decision-making.
* To explain foundational machine learning models and fuzzy logic in the context of decision support.

## Course Content
The course will cover the following topics:

### Module 1: Introduction to Expert Knowledge and Decision Support Systems

# Expert Knowledge and Decision Support Systems 

A Decision Support System (DSS) is a computer-based tool that helps individuals or organizations make better decisions by analyzing data, applying models, and presenting actionable insights. It is particularly useful for solving semi-structured and unstructured problems, where human judgment and data analysis need to work together.
